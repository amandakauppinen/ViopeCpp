**Prompt**
The purpose of this exercise is to introduce you to writing programs with C++. Below is a C++ program. Your task is to rewrite it.
In the next chapter you will learn how the program functions and what it actually does.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int number;

  cout << "Input an integer:";
  cin >> number;
  cout << "You typed: " << number << endl;
}

**Solution**

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

//The original was straightforward and I would not change it
int main() {
	int number;
	cout << "Input an integer:";
	cin >> number;
	cout << "You typed: " << number << endl;
}
